##What the project does
Indigo Fashion is a static website. The idea behind 
is to create an online store with products on display

##Why the project is useful
**A list of features were implemented with Bootstrap**
_● Items_
○ Use the grid system to add 10 items to the page.
○ Have your images become responsive (make them change when
the user moves their mouse over them).
○ Have your page display a price and name for each product.
○ Include a button under each product to “buy” the product (this does
not need to be functional yet!)

_● Footer_
○ Create a horizontal form.
○ This form should get the contact details of the customer (this does
not need to be functional yet!)
○ Include a small company logo next to the form
